## OVERVIEW:
The project explored the power of advanced data storage and retrieval to effectively analyze temperature trends on Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, summary statistics on temperature data for June and December are required to determine whether the potential surfing and ice cream shop business can be operated continuously throughout the year, rather than seasonal business.

## RESULTS:
Key Differences in Weather between June and December

<li>In June, the average temperature recorded is about 75 degrees F, which is almost 4 degrees higher than the average temperature in December.
  This accounts for -5% change in average temperature from the month of June till December.</li>

<li>The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends to have a much more normal, confirmed by the summary statistics with smaller standard deviation measure of June temps with respect to December temps.</li>

<li>The temperature in December depicts significant variation than that in June demonstrated by the maximum range in recorded temperatures based on max and min of each month recorded.</li>


## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
To summarize, the month of December would provide suitable weather conditions for both surfing and much likely to have ice cream still in the season even though temperatures recorded seem to be more than the temperature in June. 
The average temperatures in the months of June and December varied by 4 degrees, It would be ill advised to not open the surf and ice cream shop based on the recorded difference in temperatures.
